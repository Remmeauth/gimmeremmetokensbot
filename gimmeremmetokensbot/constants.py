\n[Blockexplorer](https://blockexplorer.remme.io) can be useful to check sent transactions, including yours!
Broaden horizon - [use libraries written in several programming languages](https://docs.remme.io/) to work with blockchain in many different ways!

If you are more a user than a developer, take a look at our [certificate-based authentication](https://webauth-testnet.remme.io/how-to-use) called *WebAuth*.
It allows you to log in without the password. Use keystore file generated especially for you.

If you have any questions, just ping us in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/REMME-Tech) channel.
